CSS file passed the validator with no erros.

![Jigsaw](media-readme/cssval.jpg)

## Responsiveness
- All website's pages are responsive and ested on diferent browsers: Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Opera GX and Mi(phone-Xiaomi). The following media queries were used:

- @media (min-width: 1281px)

- @media (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1280px) 

- @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 

- @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)

- @media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 767px) 

- @media (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px)

# Fixed Bugs
- Both nav sections on the header and the footer were using an id attribute, having adapted to class on css and other *html files fixed the bug.
- On the Index page there were three headings using h1. Switching h1 to h2 and having only one main top heading erased the warning in jigsaw validator. 
- Three images side by-side in the home section were hard to control. After having learned how to properly use display:flex and justify-content as other functions I could have total control over where to display them.

# Deployment
For this project I was using Gitpod browser as a development environment from where I commited and pushed my last changes to my repository in GitHub.

To deploy the project at first I had to do:
- Go to the GitHub repository Wildflour.
- Navigate to the Settings tab.
- Select main branch and save.
- In one minute and after refreshing my browser the link has been successfully depoyed.

To reasure that the link was up to date and running smoothly I refreshed on last time using the nav function called "actions".
