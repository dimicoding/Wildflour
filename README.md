### Images
All the images used on this website are of private use.

# Features

## Navigation Bar
Displayed on all 5 pages of the website, it's fully responsive and has a light underlining color when hovering and when the page is active. From here the user can easily go to Home, Recipes, Life as a Pastry Student, About, and Contact pages.
The main logo, when clicked also redirects to the home page.

![Nav Bar](media-readme/navbar.jpg)

## The Landing Page
Includes an image to activate curiosity when the user first lands on this website and promote him to scroll down the page.

![Landing Page image](media-readme/landingp.jpg)

## First Section- Recipes and Aside Section
- On the left side is displayed a section with a big title, three sample images, and a link that redirects the users to the recipes page.
- On the right side, the aside section presents a brief presentation of the author of the recipes and two links to go to the "contact" and "about" pages. 

![First Section and Aside](media-readme/fsection.jpg)

## Second Section- Sneak Peek Into My Classroom
- Maintaining the same visual concept the user is presented with a similar structure. This time below the image, with a responsive link the user gets redirected to the "Life As a Pastry Student" page.
- The image has a repetitive property turned on to make the object appear several times and create an illusion to the user of having various cakes.

![Second Section](media-readme/ssection.jpg)

## Footer
- The footer is consistent on all the pages.
- Under the name of the website, the footer also contains a vertical nav bar to allow the user no navigate easier through the pages without having to scroll up.
- The last line is presented with social media accounts which open in a new tab.

![Footer](media-readme/footer.jpg)

## Recipes Page
- Sample of one recipe, contains the name of the recipe on top, graphical representation on the side, and a catchphrase to catch the user's attention to click on the responsive link and be redirected to the specific recipe site (as this recipe is a mere illustration this link redirects back to the recipe page).

![Recipes Page](media-readme/recipes.jpg)

![Contact](media-readme/contact.jpg)

# Features Left To Implement
- Create one section mentioning the wedding cakes and showcase an image portfolio.
- Create more pages worth of recipes.
- Create a blog alike page after each topic on "life as a pastry student". Like and share buttons. Create a comment section to engage the users to participate. 
- Add a new page where the user would be redirected after the submission of the form.

# Testing

## Validator Testing
### Lighthouse
- The values obtained throughout the 5 pages of Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO maintained a very constant range, from 94 to 100.
- The value obtained from all the pages for performance fluctuated more. The average represents 88.
(example run on "Life as a Pastry Student")
![Lighthouse](media-readme/cssval.jpg)

### W3C (HTML)
HTML passed the validator with no errors or warnings to show.

![W3C](media-readme/nuhtml.jpg)

### Jigsaw (CSS)
CSS file passed the validator with no errors.
* 2 warnings on:
- 451       -webkit-right is a vendor extension
- 1030      -webkit-right is a vendor extension
![Jigsaw](media-readme/cssval.jpg)

## Responsiveness
- All website pages are responsive and tested on different browsers: Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Opera GX, and Mi(phone-Xiaomi). The following media queries were used:

- @media (min-width: 1281px)

- @media (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1280px) 

- @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) 

- @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)

- @media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 767px) 

- @media (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px)

# Fixed Bugs
- Both nav sections on the header and the footer were using an id attribute, having adapted to class on CSS and other *html files fixed the bug.
- On the Index page there were three headings using h1. Switching h1 to h2 and having only one main top heading erased the warning in the jigsaw validator. 
- Three images side by side in the home section were hard to control. After having learned how to properly use display: flex and justify-content as other functions I could have total control over where to display them.

# Deployment
For this project, I was using the Gitpod browser as a development environment from where I committed and pushed my last changes to my repository in GitHub.

To deploy the project first I had to do:
- Go to the GitHub repository Wildflour.
- Navigate to the Settings tab.
- Select the main branch and save.
- In one minute and after refreshing my browser the link has been successfully deployed.

To ensure that the link was up to date and running smoothly I refreshed on last time using the nav function called "actions".
